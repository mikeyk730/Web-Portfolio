    <p>I walk into the bus station, bags in tow.  The scene is overwhelming.  Dozens of unlabeled buses, hundreds of people.  I don't know how to pronounce the place I'm going.  I've only looked up the local name half an hour ago.  Fortunately this one is easy, Tis Isat.  As I walk, I'm shouted at.  "Gondar?  Gondar?"  No, I shake my head, "Tis Isat."  He points to the corner and I follow.  When I'm closer I call out again, "Tis Isat!  Tis Isat?"  A huge smile grows on a man's face, and a heavily accented, "Ahh, Blue Nile Waterfall!" escapes his lips.  He gestures to a bus and I get on.  The stress begins.</p>
    <p>I want to ask what time the bus will leave, but I know the answer already: when it's full.  The bus is empty, save one.  "Tis Isat?"  I ask hoping for confirmation.  She shakes her head as if she doesn't understand.  I sit down and check the time.  I think I'll be okay if it leaves within the next hour and a half.  I count 25 vacant seats.  This may take a while.  As time passes, I'm left alone with my thoughts and doubt creeps in.  Is this even the right bus?  Should I get off and ask somebody else?  I should have come in the morning, I lament.  If only I weren't up all night fighting mosquitoes.  Why didn't I just take a tour.  I'll give it 1.5 hours.</p>
    <p>Is there another bus?  I can't imagine there is to such a small place, but maybe that bus next to us, full of people, is ready to leave.  Is this even the right bus?  It must be.  Why would the tout lie about that?  You can never be sure.  I'm going to ask someone else.  Better wait for the tout to go away though.  I know what he's going to say.</p>
    <p>I get off the bus and stand in the sun.  Someone asks where I'm going.  When I tell him, he points to the same bus that I just got off of.  At least I know.</p>
    <p>People start to fill in.  Very slowly time passes, and the bus gets marginally fuller.  1/3 full, 1/2 full.  I feel a bit better, but checking the time, it's later than I thought.  I should have taken a tour.  More people stream on.  It looks nearly full, but those last few seats are a glaring problem, sticking out like a sore thumb.  I should have started in the morning.  Time would be no issue.  Now what?  Will I even have time to get there before needing to turn back?</p>
    <p>The bus rumbles to a start, the door slams, and the stress fades away.  I feel smart and fulfilled.  Those stupid people that paid so much for a tour, why didn't they just take the bus?</p>

"Mee-ster"
"Obama, how are ?"
"Where are ?"
"You'll get lost"
"You need a guide"
Is it true?  Maybe.  What could go wrong?  I'm on a short timeline.  It looks like it's going to rain.  How hard could it be to find?  It's the only reason people like me come to the area.
    </p>
    <p>We take signs, labels, maps, and directions for granted in the Western world.  It's impossible to get lost.  Here you need to know before going in, and rely on the oldest trick in the book, asking.</p>
    <p>"I'll be okay," I say to my would be guide.  "I'm very resourceful."</p>
    <p>"Okay," he shrugs, "come find me when you get lost."</p>
    <p>I carried on cautiously, knowing that what he warned against was a very real possibility.  Minutes after setting off, I had to decide: right or left?  I picked left.  Encountering a security guard, I picked wrong.  Next junction, left turn or straight?  I picked left.  What I wouldn't give to see a foreigner.</p>
    <p>Why didn't I wait for the people from my bus.  Not a soul to be seen, asking for cash, candy, or my water.  On my own.  I continued on, hearing running water.  A boost.  "Hey! Hey!"  I turn to see a boy with a donkey, pointing off the road.  "This way."</p>
